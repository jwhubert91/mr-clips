# Getting Started with MrClips

MrClips is probably the most advanced chatbot available on the net. It can serve as your site's web helper or as the sole element on your website. It inspires confidence with its strong gaze, but comforts with its knowing smile and unflinching eye contact. It is self-explanatory, and it gets the job done.

## Available packages

To install mr-clips in your package run:

`npm i mr-clips`

To use mr-clips within a React component run:

`import MrClips from 'mr-clips/MrClips'`

This imports the component and styling.

To use MrClips initialize the JSX component anywhere within your component, like so:

`<MrClips height={200} />`

**Note: You must provide a height prop equal to an integer; this establishes the height of the icon in px.**
